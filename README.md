Obstacle Detection Glasses for Blind People
Timeframe: February 2023 - March 2023

Introduction
This project introduces smart glasses designed to assist blind individuals in detecting obstacles and enhancing their mobility and safety. Using ultrasonic sensors, the glasses identify obstacles, measure their distance, and relay information via audio alerts. Additionally, fall detection is incorporated for emergency notifications, promoting independence and safety.

Features
Obstacle Detection:

Equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles within 3 meters.
Provides audio feedback proportional to the distance of the obstacle.
Fall Detection:

Integrated tilt sensor triggers an alert if the user falls.
Automatically calls the guardian for immediate assistance.
Vibration Alerts:

Vibration motor alerts users when obstacles are detected within 2 meters.
Impact
Enhances the social and academic lives of users.
Promotes user independence by enabling better navigation and communication.
Improves accessibility for low-vision individuals through innovative, user-friendly technology.
Solution Overview
This device aids blind individuals in detecting obstacles, preventing accidents, and ensuring safety during falls. The smart glasses aim to bridge the gap between low vision and independence, fostering active societal participation.
